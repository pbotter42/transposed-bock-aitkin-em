# Transposed Bock-Aitkin EM

**Software for the September 2026 preprint, not the final manuscript.**
The method and its evaluation remain under development. This release does
not provide validated parameter standard errors or confidence intervals.

This package fits binary item response models when there are many items and
relatively few subjects, such as language models answering benchmark questions.
It treats subjects' capabilities as fixed parameters and integrates over a
normal population of item effects. This reverses the usual Bock-Aitkin
integration over subjects' capabilities.

The implementation uses a Laplace approximation and a damped, normalized
posterior-moment iteration. It is **not an exact marginal-likelihood optimizer**.
The [method notes](docs/method.md) describe the equations, identification,
updates, and stopping rule.

Supported models are the 1PL and the 2PL, with either zero or estimated
correlation between item difficulty `b` and **log discrimination** `log(a)`.
There is no 3PL, 4PL, or parameter-inference API.

## Install

Use Python 3.10-3.12 (3.11 recommended) in a new virtual environment.
From a terminal with that environment active:

```sh
python -m pip install "git+https://github.com/pbotter42/transposed-bock-aitkin-em.git@v1.4.0rc1"
```

No private files, data downloads, API keys, or machine-specific paths are needed.
Dependencies are installed automatically. JAX requires a supported platform.
The release is tested locally on macOS with Python 3.11; a Linux test workflow
is configured for Python 3.10-3.12. See [release checks](docs/release-checks.md)
for what was actually run and the current GitHub Actions limitation.

## Fit a Model

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy.special import expit
from transposed_em import LaplaceIRT

rng = np.random.default_rng(42)
theta = np.linspace(-1.5, 1.5, 12)
b = rng.normal(size=80)
a = np.exp(rng.normal(0, 0.3, size=80))
responses = rng.binomial(1, expit(a * (theta[:, None] - b)))

fit = LaplaceIRT(model="2pl", covariance="full", max_iterations=40).fit(responses)
print(fit.subject_frame())
print(fit.item_frame())
print(fit.summary())
```

Rows are subjects or systems; columns are items. Responses must be `0`, `1`,
`NaN`, or `-1` (missing). A pandas DataFrame retains row and column labels.
Use `model="1pl"` for fixed discrimination, or `covariance="diagonal"` for the
2PL with zero population correlation. Computation uses 64-bit arithmetic.

The short example may reach its iteration limit. Check `stopping_reason_`
and `diagnostics_` before using estimates. The default limit is 1,000;
`fixed_point_criteria` means the numerical map was stable, not that exact
likelihood equations were solved. Item exports are conditional modes, not
posterior means. See the [API guide](docs/api.md) for prediction and new-subject
scoring, and the [reproducibility notes](docs/reproducibility.md) for the
relationship between this release and the reported analyses.

## Paper and Results

The [preprint release](https://github.com/pbotter42/transposed-bock-aitkin-em/releases/tag/v1.4.0rc1)
contains the main PDF, supplement, and an Overleaf-ready source ZIP.
The [`results/`](results) directory contains the preprint's saved result tables.
The 100-replication study and the smaller numerical diagnostic study are
distinct. The planned 200-replication study is future work, not a result of
this release. The repository does not redistribute WILD responses or claim
to reconstruct historical parameter vectors that were not saved.

For development, clone this repository, run `python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'`,
then `pytest -q`. Tests include numerical agreement with the frozen diagnostic
implementation for all three model specifications. They do not establish
statistical validity or replace the paper's planned studies.
